Stryker.NET is an open-source mutation testing framework for .NET applications. Mutation testing is a technique used to assess the effectiveness of your unit tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to your code and then checking if your tests can detect those changes. The goal is to identify weaknesses in your test suite, ensuring that it can catch real bugs in the codebase.
