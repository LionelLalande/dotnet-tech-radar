SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and serve as a guideline to help developers create well-structured and flexible code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time. SOLID principles are particularly relevant in object-oriented programming but can also be applied to other paradigms.

The five SOLID principles are:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or concern. This encourages the separation of concerns, making code easier to maintain and preventing a class from becoming too complex.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. This is typically achieved through inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should adhere to the contract and behavior defined by their superclass.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use. Instead of having large, monolithic interfaces, classes should have smaller, more focused interfaces that cater to their specific needs.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to decouple components
