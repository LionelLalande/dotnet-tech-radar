CsvHelper is an open-source .NET library that simplifies the process of reading and writing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. CSV files are commonly used for storing tabular data, and CsvHelper provides a convenient way to parse CSV data into objects and serialize objects into CSV format.

Key features and concepts of CsvHelper include:

## CSV Parsing and Writing:
CsvHelper allows you to read CSV files and write data into CSV format. It handles various aspects of CSV parsing, such as handling quoted fields, escaping special characters, and managing delimiters.

## Object Mapping:
CsvHelper enables you to map CSV records to custom .NET objects. It automatically converts CSV fields into object properties, making it easier to work with structured data.

## Attribute Mapping: 
You can use attributes to configure the mapping between CSV fields and object properties. This approach allows you to control the mapping behavior directly within your model classes.

## Type Conversion: 
CsvHelper includes built-in type conversion mechanisms to convert CSV fields to appropriate .NET types, such as converting string values to integers or dates.

## Header Mapping:
CsvHelper supports mapping based on column headers. It can match CSV header names to object property names to ensure accurate data mapping.

## Configuration Options: 
CsvHelper provides various configuration options to customize how CSV data is read and written. This includes controlling delimiter characters, handling missing fields, and more.

## Localization: 
CsvHelper supports localization for formatting dates, numbers, and other culture-specific data.

## Streaming: 
CsvHelper supports streaming, allowing you to process large CSV files efficiently without loading the entire file into memory.

## Customization: 
While CsvHelper simplifies CSV operations, it also provides extension points for more advanced scenarios. You can create custom type converters, value formatters, and more.

## NuGet Package: 
CsvHelper is available as a NuGet package, making it easy to integrate into your .NET projects.
