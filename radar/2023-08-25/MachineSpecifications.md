Machine.Specifications (MSpec) is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for .NET that is used for writing and organizing specifications (tests) in a human-readable format. It provides a way to express the behavior of a software system through descriptive specifications and assertions, making it easier to understand the intended functionality of the code being tested.
