NLog is a free logging platform for .NET with rich log routing and management capabilities. It makes it easy to produce and manage high-quality logs for your application regardless of its size or complexity.

It can process diagnostic messages emitted from any .NET language, augment them with contextual information, format them according to your preference and send them to one or more targets such as file or database.

It supports traditional logging, structured logging and the combination of both.
