Autofac is an open-source, popular inversion of control (IoC) container for .NET applications. It provides a framework for implementing the Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern, which helps manage the dependencies between classes and components within an application. Autofac enables more flexible and maintainable software development by promoting loosely coupled and modular code structures.
