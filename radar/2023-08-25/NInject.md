Ninject is an open-source lightweight dependency injection (DI) container for .NET applications. Dependency injection is a design pattern that helps manage and simplify the process of creating and managing object dependencies within an application. Ninject facilitates the implementation of inversion of control (IoC) by providing a way to define and resolve dependencies automatically.
