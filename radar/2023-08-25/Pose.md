Pose allows you to replace any .NET method (including static and non-virtual) with a delegate. It is similar to Microsoft Fakes but unlike it Pose is implemented entirely in managed code (Reflection Emit API). Everything occurs at runtime and in-memory, no unmanaged Profiling APIs and no file system pollution with re-written assemblies.
