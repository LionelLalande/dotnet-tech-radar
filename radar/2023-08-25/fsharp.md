F# is a functional-first programming language developed by Microsoft Research. It is designed to be a multi-paradigm language that combines functional programming with imperative and object-oriented programming. F# is part of the .NET ecosystem and runs on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), making it interoperable with other .NET languages like C# and VB.NET.
