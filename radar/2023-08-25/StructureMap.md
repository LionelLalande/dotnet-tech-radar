StructureMap is the oldest, continuously used IoC/DI container for .Net dating back to its first public release and production usage all the way back in June 2004 on .Net 1.1. The current 4.* release represents 12+ years of lessons learned in the StructureMap and greater .Net community -- while also wiping away a great deal of legacy design decisions that no longer make sense today.
