ArchUnit.NET is a technology that provides architectural analysis and testing capabilities for .NET applications. It is inspired by the original Java library called ArchUnit and aims to bring similar functionality to the .NET ecosystem. ArchUnit.NET helps developers enforce architectural constraints and best practices within their applications by allowing them to define and verify architectural rules.
