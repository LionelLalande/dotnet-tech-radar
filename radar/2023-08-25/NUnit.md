NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from JUnit, the current production release, version 3, has been completely rewritten with many new features and support for a wide range of .NET platforms.

NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible.
