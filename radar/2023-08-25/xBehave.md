xBehave is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for .NET that provides a way to write and execute scenarios in a more human-readable and expressive manner. It aims to enhance collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders by allowing them to define the behavior of an application using natural language specifications.
