NHibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET that provides a powerful and flexible way to map object-oriented domain models to relational database tables. NHibernate simplifies database interaction by allowing developers to work with database data using familiar object-oriented paradigms, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and data manipulation.
