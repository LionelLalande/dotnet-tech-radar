pre-commit is a tool used to manage and maintain pre-commit hooks in a Git repository. It helps automate and enforce checks on code before it's committed, ensuring that certain criteria are met before allowing the commit to proceed.

Here are the key points about "pre-commit":

## Purpose:

pre-commit is a tool designed to manage and configure pre-commit hooks in a Git repository. Pre-commit hooks are actions or scripts that are executed automatically before a commit is created.

## Hooks:

Pre-commit hooks are used to perform tasks like running code formatting, linting, static analysis, unit tests, and more. They help ensure that the committed code meets quality standards and guidelines.

## Configuration:

pre-commit allows you to define a configuration file in your repository that specifies which hooks to run and how they should be executed.

## Hooks Collection:

pre-commit provides a collection of hooks for various tasks, but you can also use custom hooks tailored to your project's requirements.

## Language Agnostic:

While "pre-commit" itself is not tied to a specific programming language or technology, it's commonly used in projects across various programming languages, including .NET.

## Ease of Use:

pre-commit simplifies the setup and management of hooks. It automatically manages the execution of hooks and can prevent commits that do not meet the defined criteria.

## Community Contributions:

Since pre-commit is widely used, there are numerous pre-configured hooks available that cover a variety of development practices and best practices.

## Open Source:

pre-commit is an open-source project, and its code is hosted on platforms like GitHub.
