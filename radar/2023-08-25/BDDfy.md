BDDfy is a .NET open-source library that stands for "Behavior-Driven Development for You." It facilitates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices in .NET projects, helping developers write human-readable and executable specifications for software behavior. BDDfy encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders by providing a common language for discussing and verifying system behavior.
