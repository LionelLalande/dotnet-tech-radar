Entity Framework (EF) is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications. It simplifies database interactions by providing an abstraction layer that allows developers to work with databases using .NET objects and queries, rather than writing raw SQL. Entity Framework supports various database providers and helps bridge the gap between the object-oriented and relational worlds.
