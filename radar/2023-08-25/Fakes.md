Fakes feature provided by Microsoft's Visual Studio, which is a part of the broader Visual Studio Test Platform. Fakes, also known as Microsoft Fakes, is a feature that allows you to create and use shims and stubs to isolate your code during unit testing. It's specifically designed to assist with testing scenarios where you need to isolate code from dependencies that are difficult to modify or control, such as external libraries or system components.
