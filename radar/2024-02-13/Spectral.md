Spectral can be used as a generic ruleset engine on any JSON or YAML data, but was built with OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema in mind. Use Spectral rules to target API descriptions for quality improvement or enforce API Style Guide rules, such as naming conventions for OpenAPI models or prohibiting integers in URLs.
